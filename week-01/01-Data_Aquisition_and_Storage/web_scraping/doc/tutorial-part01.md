# **Part 1: Introduction to Web Scraping and Scrapy**

Welcome to this hands-on introduction to web scraping with Scrapy! By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to build a simple but powerful web scraper to collect data from the web.

## **What is Web Scraping?**

Web scraping (or web harvesting) is the process of automatically extracting information from websites. Instead of a person manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a spreadsheet, a "bot" or "web crawler" does it automatically. This is useful for all sorts of applications, from market research and price comparison to data journalism and academic research.

## **What is Scrapy?**

Scrapy is a powerful Python framework for web scraping. It provides you with all the tools you need to efficiently extract data from websites, process it, and store it in your preferred format. It's asynchronous, which means it can make multiple requests at the same time, making it very fast.

## **Setting Up Your Environment**

Before we can start scraping, we need to get our environment set up.

### **Prerequisites**

* **Python 3:** You should have Python 3.6 or newer installed. You can check your version by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:  
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

* **pip:** This is Python's package installer. It usually comes with modern versions of Python.

### **Installing Scrapy**

The best way to manage your Python projects is by using virtual environments. This keeps your project dependencies separate from your system's Python installation.

1. Create a Project Folder:  
   First, create a folder for our tutorial project.  
   ```bash
   mkdir scrapy_tutorial  
   cd scrapy_tutorial
   ```

2. Create a Virtual Environment:  
   Inside your project folder, create a virtual environment.  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**  
   * **On macOS and Linux:**  
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   * **On Windows:**  
   	```bash
	.\venv\Scripts\activate
	```
You'll know it's active because your terminal prompt will change to show `(venv)`.

4. Install Scrapy:  
   Now, with your virtual environment active, you can install Scrapy using pip.  
   `pip install scrapy`

That's it\! You now have Scrapy installed and are ready to start building your first scraper.

### **The Target Website: books.toscrape.com**

For this tutorial, we will be scraping [books.toscrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com). This is a fictional bookstore website that is specifically designed for people to practice their web scraping skills. It has a catalog of books, including titles, prices, star ratings, and multiple pages to navigate.  
In the next part, we'll create our first Scrapy project and build a "spider" to crawl this website.
